Hi, this is regarding a serious issue with a laptop I purchased from your store just two months ago. It's a MacBook Air M2 and it's started acting up within a few weeks of use. The laptop keeps overheating even during light tasks like browsing and internet. And now it's randomly shutting down without warning. I use this device for work and these interruptions are causing me significant inconvenience. I have tried basic troubleshooting like updating the software and cleaning the vents, but nothing seems to work. I even contacted your customer support previously, but the solution they suggested didn't resolve the issue. It's frustrating to have a product fail this quickly. I am requesting an urgent resolution, either a replacement or a full refund. Please get back to me as soon as possible.
