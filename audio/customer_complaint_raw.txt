Hi, this is regarding a serious issue with a laptop I purchased from your store just two months ago. 
It’s a Macbook Air M2, and it started acting up within a few weeks of use. 
The laptop keeps overheating even during light tasks like browsing the internet, and 
now it’s randomly shutting down without warning. I use this device for work, and these 
interruptions are causing me significant inconvenience. I’ve tried basic troubleshooting 
like updating the software and cleaning the vents, but nothing seems to work. 
I even contacted your customer support previously, but the solution they suggested didn’t 
resolve the issue. It’s frustrating to have a product fail this quickly. I’m requesting an 
urgent resolution—either a replacement or a full refund. Please get back to me as soon as possible.
